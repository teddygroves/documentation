# Functions in LIMS

- Upload analytcal chemistry metabolomics results
upload raw results to Benchling (data table "AC quantification Raw Run") from chromeleon, Xcalibur, SmartPeak or our generic report. 
optinally refine the raw data associated withh a requset by selecting the best values for each compound.
Upload final restult to Benchling (data table "AC quantification Raw Run")

- Media
view medium recipes and calculate quantities based on the desired final volume. 

- Lineage
Browsw through the lineage of strains and cell lines that are registered on Benchling. 

- Export Experiment Data
Download experiment relted data from Benchling in different formats. 

- Register samples for a request
Creat and register samples to add to a request on Benchilng. creat a plat or box to store the sample and specify metadata reated to the samples.
