#### WE ARE CONVERTING DATA-WAREHOUSE DATABASE FROM SQL TO POSTGRESQL
reasons for this is that we have had experience,
that the banking-team sometimes made naming changes to their Post Sql database tables.
This gives os mapping conflicts in our SQL database.
To solve this we want to convert our SQL database to a Postgresql database
so that we have one to one database relations with Benchling.
