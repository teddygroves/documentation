# DATA-CAPTURE PROJECT
The scope of data capture is defined as automatic synchronisation of research data and metadata generated at DTU Biosustain from primary data providers (facilities/services) to data storage framework (data-lake). Currently the focus is on the core facilities/services such as Proteomics, Metabolomics, Fluxomics, HLPC, Glycomics, and Next-Generation Sequencing (Illumina MiSeq/NextSeq, Nanopore).

## Proteomics
- Quantitative liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS)

## Next-Generation Sequencing

- Illumina MiSeq/NextSeq
- Nanopore

## Metabolomics

- Targeted Metabolomics
- Untargeted Metabolomics

## Fluxomics

## HLPC

## Glycomics
